# Beat Sampler

The **Beat Sampler** project is an interactive application that simulates a MIDI controller with 9 different percussion instrument sounds and effects. By pressing the buttons on the interface, users can play these sounds, allowing them to create rhythms and experiment with musical combinations. It's ideal for musicians, producers, and anyone interested in music who wants to explore beat-making without the need for expensive equipment.
